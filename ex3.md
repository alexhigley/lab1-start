## My Experience 

I have primarily only coded in python, but I have done some high preformance computing in that I have had to use supercomputers in the past to do my computation. I did some pulsar timing, which required me learning SLURM Workload Manager, and getting used to writing and submitting jobs. I also was briefly part of the [DESI Collaberation](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/), where I used another supercomputer (that also used SLURM) to do a bunch of statsistics on photometric and spectroscopic data of quasars. Finally, at Argonne National Labs, I used one of their supercomputers to write a progam that deconvolved simulated muon data using a method called [Richardson Lucy Deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson%E2%80%93Lucy_deconvolution). I intermittantly will put projects on [my github](https://github.com/alexhigley), but I am not great about it.  

I have used html, bash, c-sharp, and java before, but I would not feel comfortable to claim that I "know" those langauages. I know enough to get through whatever project in the past required me to use them. 


## My Goals

- I would like to be more familiar with Julia. I have not coded in Julia before so I am looking forward to learning a new language. 
- Even though I feel like I have done a lot of programming, I don't really have any formal training. I never really took a formal class about computing, and almost everything I know is from google or mentors I had as an undergraduate. Because of this, I feel like I have a lot of strange gaps in my knowlege. For example, I don't really know how to use git. I don't really know how to set up an environment. I don't know a lot of the terminology thrown around (what is the difference between a CPU and a GPU?). As such, I think one of my other goals for this course is to try to fill some of these gaps in my knowledge.
- I am interested in improving my programming skills overall. I want to know how to use Julia to parallel program, but I also just want to know how to code more effeciently and smartly. I have a habit of not thinking about pressing "run" and just doing it— I would like to be more concious about what I code before running it. I also want to get into the habit of coding as general as possible, commenting well, and naming my variables things that aren't just random sounds. 

#### Objectives
- Learn Julia and become more familiar with parallel programming in general.
- Learn how specifically ROAR Collab works and write a program that utilizes its resources
- Learn more about git
- Improve my ability to code and program generally — I want to know how to improve my effeciency and correctness, as well as my judgement to discern what is best to priortize when programming for my research.
